# Gemini's Project Guide: mini-textarea

This document outlines my understanding of the "mini-textarea" project and how I can assist in its development.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a fast, simple, and reliable `<textarea>` component that "just works". The project is built using Vite and TypeScript.

## My Role

As an AI assistant, I am here to help you with various aspects of this project. My capabilities include:

*   **Feature Implementation:** I can help implement new features, such as the PWA setup mentioned in the `TODO` list.
*   **Code Refactoring:** I can refactor existing code to improve its readability, performance, and maintainability.
*   **Writing Tests:** I can write unit and integration tests to ensure the quality and reliability of the component.
*   **Bug Fixing:** I can help identify and fix bugs in the codebase.
*   **Documentation:** I can assist in writing and updating documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can ask me to:

*   Implement the PWA setup.
*   Add a new feature to the textarea.
*   Write tests for a specific part of the code.

I look forward to collaborating with you on this project!
